### Professional Self-Assessment

My journey through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has been both challenging and rewarding. Coming from a background in manufacturing, where I’ve worked hands-on with systems, automation, and precision processes, I was already used to solving technical problems in fast-paced environments. However, I wanted to take that mindset further — to not just operate and maintain systems, but to design, develop, and improve them through software. That desire for growth led me to pursue my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. I wanted to push myself mentally, learn to think differently, and gain the ability to create software solutions that make systems — and people — more efficient.

When I first started this program, I had limited experience with programming beyond some basic automation logic. The early courses were tough, and learning how to think computationally took patience and persistence. There were moments when debugging code late at night after long work shifts felt impossible, but each time I solved a problem, that sense of accomplishment reminded me why I started this journey in the first place. Over time, I learned that software engineering isn’t just about writing code — it’s about building solutions that matter and thinking critically about efficiency, security, and scalability.

One of the most valuable parts of this program has been learning how to collaborate effectively and communicate clearly. Through group projects and peer reviews, I developed the ability to discuss technical concepts with others, merge different ideas into one cohesive solution, and adapt based on constructive feedback. In the professional world, collaboration is critical, and these experiences taught me to be open, analytical, and flexible when working in teams. I’ve also learned how to communicate with non-technical stakeholders — a skill I’ve applied in my current job when explaining technical systems or process changes to others who may not share the same background.

In my Software Design and Engineering coursework, I learned how to approach development from an architectural perspective. Designing structured, maintainable, and secure code became second nature as I worked on multiple projects that emphasized modularity and clean design. Enhancing these projects for my ePortfolio reminded me how far I’ve come — from writing basic functions to developing organized, scalable applications. I particularly enjoyed working with the Spring framework and Java, which helped me better understand how large systems interact and how to structure code for real-world enterprise applications.

My Algorithms and Data Structures work helped me see the beauty in efficiency. Understanding how data moves and is manipulated within a program allowed me to build systems that perform better and handle more complex operations. Implementing sorting algorithms, binary search trees, and hash tables challenged me to think logically and mathematically — skills that translate directly into my professional life, especially in manufacturing and process optimization. It gave me confidence to tackle algorithmic problems on my own and make smarter decisions when choosing data structures for different use cases.

The Databases category has been advantageous for me because it connects directly to real-world problem-solving. I learned how to design and secure databases, work with SQL, and implement parameterized queries to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection. My Secure Database Interaction project from CS 405: Secure Coding allowed me to integrate encryption and access control features, turning it into a professional-quality demonstration of secure data management. Enhancing this artifact helped me understand how software, security, and data all intersect — a connection I’ve grown increasingly passionate about as I consider my long-term goals.

Security, in particular, became one of the most eye-opening parts of my journey. Before this program, I didn’t fully understand how vulnerable systems could be until I learned about exploits, encryption, and secure coding principles. Now, I approach every design decision with a security-first mindset, ensuring that data and users are protected at every level. From hashing passwords to validating inputs, I’ve learned to code with the mindset of anticipating threats — not just reacting to them.

As I reflect on my journey, this program has reshaped the way I think, work, and solve problems. I’ve grown from someone who worked with machines and systems into someone who can build and secure the software that drives them. My Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases artifacts represent the culmination of that growth — three connected areas that demonstrate my ability to design, optimize, and secure full-scale applications. Each one showcases a different strength, but together, they form a complete picture of my technical skill set and professional readiness.

Completing this ePortfolio has helped me realize that I’m not just earning a degree — I’m building a career foundation rooted in creativity, logic, and discipline. I’m proud of how far I’ve come, and I know that this is just the beginning. My goal is to continue growing as a software developer, taking what I’ve learned about engineering, data, and security to create real-world solutions that make technology safer, smarter, and more efficient. This journey has been one of perseverance and transformation, and I’m ready to take these skills into the professional world with confidence and purpose.

### Code Review

This code review script serves as a formal analysis of software quality, demonstrating my ability to critically evaluate source code for security, efficiency, and maintainability. The review identifies potential vulnerabilities, improper input handling, and algorithmic inefficiencies while assessing adherence to established coding standards. This artifact highlights my understanding of secure software development practices, systematic problem-solving, and attention to detail—skills essential for professional competency in computer science and software engineering.

### Software Design and Engineering Enhancement

The artifact I chose to enhance was a Python project from CS 340: Client/Server Development. This enhancement demonstrates my ability to design modular, scalable, and maintainable software systems. I refactored a client/server application to include a RESTful API layer, role-based authentication, and improved modularity, showcasing proficiency in software architecture, secure coding practices, and system design principles. This artifact reflects my understanding of best practices in software engineering and my ability to implement professional-grade solutions.
